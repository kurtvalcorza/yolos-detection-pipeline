Notebook specification: **DIMER Notebook Specification 2.1**. The notebook is **standalone** (§4) and declares its profile and pedagogical mode (§3.4). `tools/build_notebook.py` generates it from `tools/notebook_template.py`, and it carries the package's modules, the model identity, the snapshot manifest and the runtime pins, so the exported `.ipynb` works without this repository. Do not edit the notebook by hand: edit the package or the template and regenerate (`python tools/build_notebook.py`; CI and the validator enforce `--check`).

| Notebook | Profile | Mode | Carrier | Capability | Default runtime | Sample | BYOD | Run-all | Release status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `yolos_detection_colab.ipynb` | `E2E` | `GUIDED` | standalone (generated) | COCO detection with `hustvl/yolos-small`, and a bounded fine-tune that re-heads YOLOS onto a three-class sign vocabulary, evaluates baseline and adapted AP@[.50:.95] and AP50 on a held-out split, infers on unseen images, and exports and reloads a SafeTensors adapter | CUDA GPU (T4 class) documented; CPU also runs | automatic (640×480 COCO scene and 40-image sign dataset, both drawn in code) | single image or labelled dataset directory, off by default; location fields `BYOD_IMAGE_PATH`, `BYOD_DATASET_DIR`; uploads stay in the runtime | default-path execution recorded on 2026-09-25 (Kaggle T4); REL12 BYOD exercise pending before promotion; see `../docs/release-verification.md` | **Candidate** |

## Conformance notes

- **Standalone carrier (§4):** the default path performs no clone, repository install or repository import. Section 2 carries `samples.py` and `pipeline.py` verbatim in dependency order (tagged `metadata.dimer.embedded_module`; the only rewrite makes the default weights directory working-directory-relative). Section 3 carries the model identity and the manifest inline and asserts that they agree with the module before anything is fetched. Section 1 carries the exact `pyproject.toml` runtime pins.
- **Parity (PAR1–PAR3):** `tests/test_notebook_parity.py` and `tools/validate_release_assets.py` fail when a carried module, the inline manifest or the inline pins differ from the repository, or when the notebook differs from the generator's output.
- **Model acquisition (MOD1–MOD8):** the snapshot is pinned to an immutable revision (the three loaders would raise before any download if `MODEL_REVISION` were reset to `"unpinned"`). `stage_missing_files(WEIGHTS_DIR, allow_download=True)` fetches only the absent manifest entries at the immutable revision, `verify_snapshot` re-hashes every entry, and `from_pretrained(weights_dir=WEIGHTS_DIR)` loads with `local_files_only=True` and `trust_remote_code=False`.
- **Stages:** `validate_inputs` writes the input manifest, including one rejection finding from the `threshold=1.5` probe; `evaluation_report` writes the single-image `sample-sanity` report; `validate_dataset` validates the adaptation records; `evaluate` computes AP before and after `finetune`; `save_artifact` writes `outputs/yolos_adapter.safetensors`; `load_artifact` rebuilds from the verified base and the adapter, and the notebook compares detections within a stated tolerance.
- **Scores (UNC1–UNC4):** every `score` is a softmax probability over the classes plus "no object", not a calibration for the reader's images. `threshold` is a `# @param` field passed explicitly on every `detect` call.
- **Non-interactive execution (EXE1–EXE4):** seeds, schedule, threshold, BYOD switches and BYOD locations are form fields; outputs go to `outputs/` under the working directory.
- `tools/validate_release_assets.py` performs source validation only. It does not satisfy the clean-runtime execution requirement; a release review must confirm that a recorded clean run in `docs/release-verification.md` matches the notebook revision under review before the status is promoted to `Release-grade`.
