        "YOLOS (You Only Look at One Sequence) Small (`hustvl/yolos-small`) is a plain Vision Transformer (ViT-S/16) turned into a detector "
        "with as few changes as possible: 100 learnable **detection tokens** are appended to the image's patch tokens, the 12-layer encoder "
        "processes them together, and two small MLP heads read one box and one class distribution from each detection token. It is trained "
        "with the same set-prediction loss as DETR, so there is no convolutional backbone, no decoder, no anchor box and no non-maximum "
        "suppression (NMS). At inference the processor resizes the image so its shorter side is 800 px, and every detection token whose best "
        "class probability reaches a caller-owned threshold is returned as an xyxy box in input pixels.\n\n"

        "COCO (`stop-sign`, `yield-sign`, `speed-limit-sign`), measures a pre-adaptation baseline, runs a bounded fine-tune with the patch "
        "embedding and the first 8 encoder layers frozen, scores the result on a held-out split with COCO-style average precision "
        "(AP@[.50:.95] and AP50), runs the adapted model on unseen images, exports the changed tensors as a SafeTensors adapter, and reloads "
        "that adapter onto a fresh copy of the verified base model to check that it reproduces the same detections. Every number you see is "

        "precision before and after. The adapter was exported, reloaded onto a fresh base model and checked against the in-memory detections.\n\n"
        "**What a green run proves.** Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision, the pinned dependency set and the "
        "pinned checkpoint together reproduce these stages in a fresh runtime, without the repository being cloned or installed and without "
        "any DIMER worker or service. It does **not** establish benchmark superiority, fitness for any deployment, or that the adapted model "
        "generalises beyond the synthetic images it was fitted to. The held-out AP is measured on 10 drawn images and carries no dispersion "
        "estimate. The scores are not calibrated probabilities.\n\n"
        "**Reproducibility.** Seeds are form fields (`DATASET_SEED`, `SEED`, `NEW_DATA_SEED`), the run is float32 with no data augmentation, "
        "and the class head is initialised under `SEED`. GPU kernels are not forced to be deterministic, so repeated GPU runs can differ in "
        "the last digits of the loss and the scores.\n\n"
        "**Try next.** Change `FREEZE_EARLY_LAYERS` to `False` and compare held-out AP and runtime, or change `EPOCHS` and watch where held-out AP "
        "stops improving. To transfer the workflow, point `BYOD_DATASET_DIR` at a small labelled set from your own domain.\n\n"
